# Data analysis on tuberculosis burden by country

## Project introduction

Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the world's deadliest infectious diseases, disproportionately affecting low- and middle-income countries. Despite being preventable and curable, TB continues to claim millions of lives annually, particularly in regions burdened by poverty, limited healthcare access, and high HIV prevalence.

## Data source

The dataset used in this analysis was obtained from Tableau Public and contains country-level tuberculosis (TB) burden estimates. It includes annual data on TB incidence, prevalence, mortality (including HIV-related TB mortality), population estimates, and other indicators relevant to TB surveillance and control efforts. The dataset can be downloaded [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/sample-data/TB_Burden_Country.csv?_gl=1*6goded*_ga*ODE4MDkwNjQ1LjE3Mzk4NDIyNzE.*_ga_8YLN0SNXVS*MTczOTg0MjI2OS4xLjEuMTczOTg0MjMzMS4wLjAuMA..)

## Purpose of analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to examine global tuberculosis (TB) patterns using the dataset from Tableau Public. By analyzing key metrics such as TB incidence, mortality, prevalence, HIV co-infection rates, and case detection rates, this study aims to uncover meaningful relationships and trends. Through correlation analysis, linear regression, and clustering techniques, the analysis seeks to understand how these variables interact, identify groups of countries with similar TB burdens. The insights gained can support targeted public health strategies, inform global TB control efforts, and guide resource allocation for high-impact interventions.
